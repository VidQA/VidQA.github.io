	<h2> VidQA - Automated Comprehension Check of Learning Videos </h2>

	<div style="text-align: justify">
		<p> The project is funded by the
			<a href="https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/foerderung/foerderangebot/zukunftniedersachsen-innovation-fachhochschulen-beendet">
				VolkswagenFoundation</a>.
			The aim of this project is to implement a novel system (using a deep learning approach) that can capture the content of educational videos on a multimodal level and generate content-specific questions and corresponding answers.
		</p>

		<p> Educational videos convey detailed information about specific topics on a multimodal level. The learners' understanding is reinforced with visual (frames of the video), auditory (sound of the video) and textual (subtitles of the spoken word, if available) content. Since the pandemic, the importance of learning videos has increased due to the location- and time-independent aspects. The success of learning with videos depends on the activation of the learner. Semi-automatically generated questions and their correct answers (multiple choice answers, free text answers) should serve as a support. Almost no work has been done in this area of research that focuses on the multimodal aspects of videos. Instead, text-based approaches are used, e.g. language transcripts as input for question generation. As a result, not all information in a video is taken into account which results in a less accurate question generation.
		</p>

		<p> This project includes the research, development and evaluation of new methods that use all multimodal aspects of a learning video to semi-automatically generate questions and answers. Various steps have been defined for the implementation of such a system:
		</p>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data collection and processing as a data basis</li>
				<li>Multimodal information extraction from learning videos</li>
				<li>Generation of questions on content-specific informations</li>
				<li>Generation of possible answers to the questions</li>
				<li>Generation of distractors (false answers) for multiple-choice questions</li>
				<li>Evaluation and explanation of answers to open questions</li>
				<li>
					<p>System integration and evaluation (e.g. integration into the
						<a href="https://av.tib.eu/">
							TIB AV Portal</a>)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
